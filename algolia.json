From scale point of view, ESXi supports 10 network interfaces per VM. So, if 1 interface is used for upline, 1 for management, then, 8 segments can be used to create security zones.- Security zone in these options can either be \u0026amp;lsquo;a segment\u0026amp;rsquo; or \u0026amp;lsquo;an isolated NSX-T T1 gateway\u0026amp;rsquo; On the NSX-T T1, configure a summary static route for all the south-bound segments with next hop set to NVA.
